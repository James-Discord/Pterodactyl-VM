# Pterodactyl-VM
This is just a VM made by https://github.com/afnan007a?tab=repositories this is again not mine.

first make a server (js/py/java server)
then download the server.py, server.jar or server.js file

then upload the files to your server via file manager or sftp

then go to startup section of the server and name it server.py (if u made python server and downloaded the server.py file) or server.js (if u made js server and downloaded the server.js file) server.jar (if u made java server and downloaded the server.jar file)

now start the server and it will install the files for you and run PteroVM

you're done
